Java implementations of linked list–based data structures and algorithms completed as part of a data structures assignment.

# Linked List Implementations in Java

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of a coursework assignment focused on linked list data structures and related algorithms.

## Files

- `LLList.java`  
  Implements a generic singly linked list with basic operations such as add, remove, get, and iteration. Supports tracking the last item for efficient access.

- `LLBag.java`  
  Implements a bag (multiset) using a linked list. Provides methods to add, remove, check for containment, grab a random element, and convert to an array.

- `Palindrome.java`  
  Contains a method to check whether a string is a palindrome. Uses a stack-based approach to efficiently handle characters, ignoring case and non-letter characters.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Singly linked list implementation
- Node-based data structures
- Iterators and list traversal
- Stack usage for algorithmic checks
- Algorithmic thinking and complexity
- Defensive programming (null checks, bounds checking)
